Here's an example of a `README.md` with instructions on how to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```markdown
# Game Project with Pygame

This project is a Python-based game using Pygame. It includes both client-server functionality, allowing you to either host a game or join an existing server.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caidenm11/371-Group01.git
cd 371-Group01
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps to manage dependencies and keep them isolated from your system environment.

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

This will create a new folder named `venv` in your project directory.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Once activated, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install all the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Pygame and any other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### 5. Running the Game

You can now run the game by using the appropriate entry point.

To start a new game:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

Below is for future reference.

~~
- To start a new game and host a server:
  ```bash
  python main.py --host
  ```

- To join an existing server:
  ```bash
  python main.py --join <server_address>
  ```
~~

### 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once youâ€™re done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will return you to your global Python environment.




### Changes
~~

#### Server

To run the server standalone currently just after installing all of the packages run python (or python3 on mac) startserver.py.


#### Client 
run python (or python3 on mac) startclient.py --host <server_address> to connect to the server.
  To connect from a client that's on the same wifi, find the server's local IP address and use that as the host.

  To find the local IP address of the server, run `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Linux/Mac.

  The local IP address is typically in the format 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x.

  To run this will be in the format python `startclient.py --host 192.168.1.42`
      where `192.168.1.42` is the local IP address of the server.
